**Online Shoppers Intentions Using ML**

SKILLS REQUIRED:
CNN, ML, WEB APP FLASK

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Online shopping is the activity or action of buying products or services over the Internet. 
It means going online, landing on a sellerâ€™s website, selecting something, and arranging for its delivery. 
The buyer either pays for the good or service online with a credit or debit card or upon delivery. 
The term does not only include buying things online but also searching for them online. 
In other words, I may have been engaged in online shopping but did not buy anything.
We are going to predict whether the customer will buy the product or just go window shopping . 
Here, We will be using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression , Random forest, & Clustering algorithm K-Means.
We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format.
